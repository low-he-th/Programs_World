Finding the Smallest Number

Alice is playing a game where she's given a list of numbers and she needs to find the smallest number. Write a Java program to help Alice find the smallest number in an array.

Hint: Initialize a variable to store the smallest number, then iterate through the array and update the variable if a smaller number is found.
