Scenario: William wants to create a calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using method overloading. He needs a program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and displays the result.

**Hint**: William can create four overloaded methods, each named `calculate`, to handle different operations. Each method should take two numbers as inputs and return the result of the respective operation. Inside each method, he can use a `switch` statement to determine the operation and perform the calculation accordingly.

Sample Output:

Enter the first number: 10

Enter the second number: 5

Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): +

Result: 15.0
